<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I already have the C-z binding disabled. But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn&#39;t loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI. Now I have to restart Emacs and redo that work for no good reason.</p> <p>Being able to suspend Emacs from a terminal makes sense, but why does this feature exist at all when running it in a GUI? If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.</p> <p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program. I already tried all the suggestions on <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/349943/how-to-awake-emacs-gui-after-pressing-ctrlz">this page</a>.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t be the first to complain about this. Would a bug report be a waste of time?</p> <p>EDIT: I meant <code>suspend-frame</code> (can&#39;t edit titles on Reddit).</p> <p>EDIT2 (Update): It&#39;s only the Emacs master-branch which I compile from the git-cloned source that becomes completely unresponsive.</p> <p>If I&#39;m using Emacs 28.1 on the same desktop/OS and press C-z, it merely iconifies the frame.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thetemp_"> /u/thetemp_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wodg65/why_is_suspendemacs_enabled_at_all_in_gui_mode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wodg65/why_is_suspendemacs_enabled_at_all_in_gui_mode/">[comments]</a></span>
