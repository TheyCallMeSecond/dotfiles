<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have seen a push toward native compilation with gccemacs. If i remember correctly, some common lisp implementations already compile lisp to machine code (like sbcl). Since elisp and common lisp are both in the same family, i was wondering how difficult would it be to compile the elisp libraries in emacs into common lisp, load them into an sbcl image, and obtain emacs with native compilation built in. </p> <p>This could be further interfaced with other common lisp projects like Nyxt to provide further functionality. Would something like this be feasible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fabio_grosso"> /u/fabio_grosso </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmcdup/could_one_compile_elisp_to_common_lisp/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmcdup/could_one_compile_elisp_to_common_lisp/">[comments]</a></span>
