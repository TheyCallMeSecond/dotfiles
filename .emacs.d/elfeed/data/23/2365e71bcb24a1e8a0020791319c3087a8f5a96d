<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone know how to automatically give an extra line between org-mode headers, and maybe two lines between level 1 headers? The way that org-mode can feel so crowded, and automatically removes my extra newlines upon saves drives me a bit bonkers. Any tips/suggestions?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TyrionBean"> /u/TyrionBean </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wpr2n2/orgmode_paddingspacing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wpr2n2/orgmode_paddingspacing/">[comments]</a></span>
