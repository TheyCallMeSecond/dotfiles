<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone experience rare hiccups using emacs. For example maybe once a day when writing, the cursor or a command might freeze for a second. I know it&#39;s really nothing major, just bothers me a bit and i&#39;m wondering if this is a common occurrence with emacs or is it just my system. It can happen more often when folding-unfolding headers in an org file, just a small delay (~1sec) at random, for the action to perform. Not searching for the magic solution, just wanted to see if it is just me or if i might be doing something wrong.</p> <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p> <p>P.S. My config is really minimal, just the colorscheme, ivy, haskell mode, yasnippet, auctex and my key maps. Also my pc is 7 yo but its more than capable of running intense tasks, and i think vanilla Emacs isn&#39;t one of them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CrispyBoye"> /u/CrispyBoye </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wp3ggr/small_hiccups/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wp3ggr/small_hiccups/">[comments]</a></span>
