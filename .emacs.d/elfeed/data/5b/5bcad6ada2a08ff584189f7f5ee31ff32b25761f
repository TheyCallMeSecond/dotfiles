The market for productivity applications is saturated with apps and other complex systems to manage your actions. While these systems provide great functionality, the main problem is that you have to use them the way the designer intended instead of how you like to work. This article shows how to use Org mode to get things done with Emacs and configure a bespoke productivity system.</p>
<p>
The approach in the article roughly follows the concepts of David Allen&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) system. This is, however, not the only method to manage your affairs. Whatever your preferred workflow looks like, you can <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/configure-emacs/">configure Emacs</a> to help you with that.</p>
<p>
This article is part of a series on how to use <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/more-productive-with-emacs/">Emacs to become more productive</a>. If you are new to Emacs, then feel free to read any of the previous articles.</p>

<h2 id="headline-1">
The Productivity Quest
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The quest to become more productive has become a popular past time. Millions of people around the world struggle with the demands of life in the twenty-first century and they constantly look for ways to cram more activities into their day. Self-proclaimed productivity gurus have published piles of popular books about methods to get more done in your limited available time.</p>
<p>
All these methods boil down to three basic principles: set a goal, define the actions to achieve that goal and undertake these actions. These principles might sound simplistic, but it is the basic truth. The plethora of methods merely discuss different ways on how to manage these three steps effectively and efficiently. A central theme of these methods are means to process the enormous amount of information that people are exposed to every day.</p>
<p>
In the slipstream of the productivity gurus, software developers have released many apps to manage the information stream of our daily lives. The internet contains many stories about people who moved from one application to the next, in search of the perfect way to manage their projects and tasks. I was one of those people, until I started using Emacs.</p>
<p>
Org mode is an ideal system to help you getting things done. The Org mode package not only allows you to <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/emacs-for-distraction-free-writing/">write prose</a>, it is also helps you to manage actions and projects. As with any other Emacs package, it provides virtually unlimited freedom to implement your favourite method to get stuff done.</p>
<p>
This chapter shows how to use Org Mode to manage your projects and tasks, loosely based on David Allen&#39;s <em>Getting Things Done</em> (GTD) method. David Allen describes iterative five steps to become more productive:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Capture</em>: Empty your mind</li>
<li><em>Clarify</em>: Describe what it all means</li>
<li><em>Organise</em> Place it where it belongs</li>
<li><em>Reflect</em>: Reflect on your progress</li>
<li><em>Engage</em>: Take action</li>
</ol>

Capture: Empty Your Head
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>One of the reasons we are often not as productive as we like is because our minds are filled with issues. When our brain is full of thoughts about what we should be doing, we start to worry about how busy we are instead of doing the thing we need to do. David Allen says that &#34;Our minds are for having ideas, not for holding them&#34;.</p>
<p>
The first step to getting things done is to <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/clear-your-head/">empty your mind</a>. This is not a Buddhism-inspired quest for enlightenment, but a simple technique to help you focus. A brain only has a limited capacity as we can only have one thought at a time. When your brain is full of thoughts about what you should be doing, creative and productive thoughts are suppressed.</p>
<p>
The other problem with keeping ideas in your head is the risk that they will disappear in the fog of your brain. I am sure you all recognise the experience of having the most wonderful idea when enjoying your morning shower, but half an hour later you are unable to recall your gem.</p>
<p>
Open a new Org Mode file with the <code class="verbatim">find-file</code> function (<code class="verbatim">C-x X-f</code>). You can call it something like <code class="verbatim">todo.org</code> or whatever you fancy. For the next fifteen minutes, write down everything that is floating around in your head. Dump the contents of your brain into this virgin Org Mode file. Try not to <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/myth-of-multitasking/">multitask</a> when you empty your mind, but fully focus your attention on the list.</p>
<p>
Start every new idea with an asterisk so that they become headlines. Your list will contain a jumble of things. From minor household tasks to big future projects you want to do one day. Don&#39;t filter your thoughts. Just write them down. Your list might look something like this:</p>
<div class="src src-org">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-org" data-lang="org"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold">*</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> Mow the lawn</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold">*</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> Empty your e-mail inbox</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold">*</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> Prepare presentation for the quarterly meeting next week</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold">*</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> And so on, and so on ...</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
For the next twenty-five minutes, focus only on this task and write down everything that is in your head. Don&#39;t multitask and give this activity your undivided attention. <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/myth-of-multitasking/">Multitasking is the enemy of productivity</a> because our brains can only focus on one intellectual activity at a time. The fact that magicians can so easily fool people illustrates why multitasking is a fool&#39;s errand. Perhaps <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/configure-emms/">listen to some instrumental music</a> with the Emacs EMMS package to keep you focused.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t spend any time thinking about these tasks. Don&#39;t worry about when you&#39;ll need to do it or in what order they need to be done just yet. Ensure that your mind is empty by the time you complete your list. If the list only has about a dozen items, then your list is not complete. For most people, fifty actionable items, projects and fuzzy goals are not unusual. If you are overwhelmed by the list then don&#39;t shoot the messenger as it merely reflects your life. If it takes you longer than twenty five minutes to empty your mind, then take a five minute break and start again.</p>
<p>
You now have a long list of all the stuff you need to get done. But that is only the starting point. Org mode also has functions that can capture tasks as they come up in random moments of the day.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
Managing distractions
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When you are focusing on a task, it is almost inevitable that you mind occasionally wanders to a different topic and all of a sudden you remember that you need to order theatre tickets. Don&#39;t break your workflow, write it down and move on with your more creative work. Some authors keep a distraction notebook to record anything that is not related to the task at hand.</p>
<p>
Org mode provides a built-in distraction notebook with capture templates. This functionality is highly configurable an this article sticks to the basics only. To enable the basic functionality, add the following to your init file:</p>
<div class="src src-emacs-lisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#888">;; Capture distractions</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#963">global-set-key</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;\C-c c&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a60;background-color:#fff0f0">&#39;org-capture</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#007020">setq</span> <span style="color:#963">org-capture-templates</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>          <span style="color:#333">&#39;</span>((<span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;d&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;Distraction&#34;</span> <span style="color:#963">entry</span> (<span style="color:#963">file+headline</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;~/Documents/notes/distractions.org&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;Notes&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>           <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;* %?\n%T&#34;</span>)))</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The capture functionality has no default keybinding and Org mode recommends using <code class="verbatim">C-c c</code>. The next line directs all your distractions to the <code class="verbatim">distractions.org</code> file in your notes folder plus a timestamp. </p>
<p>
When you are in a productive flow-state and your suddenly remember that you soon need to rubbish bins out, simply press <code class="verbatim">C-c c</code> and <code class="verbatim">d</code> to enter your distraction. When done, use <code class="verbatim">C-c C-c</code> to save the entry and continue with your train of thought. Org mode saves the note to your distractions file, which you can add to your agenda list.</p>
<p>
This is only a simple example of how to use this functionality. The capture templates in Org mode has extensive capabilities to configure the type of notes and where they are stored. You can have several types of notes, which will appear in a menu.</p>
<p>
This functionality integrates nicely with the <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/taking-notes-with-emacs-org-mode-and-org-roam/">Org-Roam package for taking notes</a>. In my system, I have an inbox file registered in Org-Roam where I dump all my random thoughts which I process as part of my weekly review.</p>
<p>
For those of you on the go, there are some Org mode mobile applications that link to a file shared through cloud service such as Dropbox.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
Clarify: Describe what it all means
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Did you notice that most things on the list above, apart from items 6 and 7, are more extensive than just one action?</p>
<p>
In GTD-speak, they&#39;re called projects, which are &#34;desired outcomes that take more than one action to complete&#34; or goals. Goals are helpful to define, but can not be acted on immediately. </p>
<p>
Your list will be a mess of tasks, projects, goals and vague ideas. Your next task is to organise them. Firstly you can add some order and hierarchy to the list with the <code class="verbatim">ALT</code> and arrow keys. <code class="verbatim">M-up</code> and <code class="verbatim">M-down</code> will move a heading up or down, while <code class="verbatim">M-right</code> and <code class="verbatim">M-left</code> will promote or demote your entry.</p>
<p>
With these four keystrokes, you can organise your list so that projects and tasks go together and create some order in the chaos that came from your mind. So the garden becomes a project with two tasks:</p>
<div class="src src-org">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-org" data-lang="org"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold">*</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> Upgrade garden</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#800080;font-weight:bold">**</span> Clean up the backyard
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#800080;font-weight:bold">**</span> Mow the lawn</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
If you like a bit more clarity on your list, you can collapse a heading with the <code class="verbatim">TAB</code> key. Using <code class="verbatim">S-TAB</code> will collapse the whole document to only the first-level headlines,</p>
<p>
You can also add notes or link images below any heading to provide some context to the task by hitting enter at the end of the headline and typing.</p>
<p>
Your list is starting to take shape now. The following steps will add more context to your tasks. If you like do some more finessing, then read my article on <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/emacs-for-distraction-free-writing/">writing prose with Org mode</a>.</p>

Organise: Place it where it belongs
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When new information, a thought, email and so on arrives in your inbox, you can use Emacs to process the information. If the information does not require you to action it, then you can store it in your Org-Roam folder. Using <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/taking-notes-with-emacs-org-mode-and-org-roam/">Org-Roam for taking notes</a> help you find and connect your information to create a personal knowledge garden.</p>

<p>
If the new item is actionable and it only takes a few minutes to do, then just go ahead and do it; don&#39;t waste your time on recording the action.</p>
<p>
The last step is to record your actionable item so it appears in your agenda.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Action Status
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Org mode can associate each headline in a document with a workflow state. By default, there are only two states, <code class="verbatim">TODO</code> or <code class="verbatim">DONE</code>. You can change the state of a heading with the shift and arrow keys. Org mode will cycle between the two states. The keywords are commonly written in all caps, but that is not necessary.</p>
<p>
You can define workflow states any way you like. Adding the following Lisp lines to your init file will set your workflow states. The states after the vertical bar will be marked as completed, usually coloured green.</p>
<p>
If you have many states, cycling through them can be tedious. The <code class="verbatim">C-c C-t</code> command provides a popup menu to quickly select your option. You add the menu letter between parentheses after the keyword like this:</p>
<div class="src src-emacs-lisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#888">;; Todo keywords. Change these to your liking</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#007020">setq</span> <span style="color:#963">org-todo-keywords</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#333">&#39;</span>((<span style="color:#963">sequence</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;TODO(t)&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;NEXT(n)&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;WAITING(w)&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;|&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;DONE(d)&#34;</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;CANCELLED(c)&#34;</span>)))</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
You could, for example, follow the GTD approach and have a status for next actions, waiting for others or cancelled actions. There are, in principle, no limitations to how you use this functionality.</p>
<p>
The basic principle of the GTD approach is not to have massive lists of items that you like to do one day but that you define the next action that needs to be done to achieve your goal, or schedule activities in your diary. This method ensures that only a subset of activities is in your consciousness and  you don&#39;t get overwhelmed by your inactivity as action lists tend to be long list of promises to our future selves.</p>
<p>
You can set different keywords can for each Org file. When, for example, you are writing a book, you could set specific keywords for each heading with the following line in your header:</p>
<div class="src src-org">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-org" data-lang="org"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#c00;font-weight:bold">#+TODO</span><span style="color:#888">: TODO(t) DRAFT(d) | DONE(c) EDITED(e)</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-7">
Adding dates and deadlines
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Now that your list is nicely organised in the stuff you need to do, add dates to some of the tasks. A task without a date is merely a dream. Scheduling a task to a specific date is to commit your recalcitrant future self to the action.</p>
<p>
You can add a date that the task is scheduled or a deadline. A scheduled date indicates the date or period you wan to work on the task. A dealine is the time the task needs to be completed.</p>
<p>
To add a scheduled date, use <code class="verbatim">C-c C-s</code> when on a headline. Emacs will pop up a calendar that you can use to select a date. The shift and arrow buttons let you move around by day or week. The <code class="verbatim">&lt;</code> and <code class="verbatim">&gt;</code> symbols move you a month in time. Press enter when done, and the date appears below the headline. You can add a deadline in a similar way but with the <code class="verbatim">C-c C-a</code> keystroke.</p>
<p>
Scheduled dates help set a regular schedule. For example, suppose you add, for instance, <code class="verbatim">+ 7d</code> at the end of the date. In that case, Org-Mode recalculates the date every time you complete the task and resets the status to TODO. You can also use the letters <code class="verbatim">w</code>, <code class="verbatim">m</code> and <code class="verbatim">y</code> for scheduling a job weekly, monthly or yearly.</p>
<div class="src src-org">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-org" data-lang="org"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">* </span>TODO Complete Org-Mode article
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  DEADLINE: &lt;<span style="background-color:#fff0f0">2021-05-09 Sun</span>&gt; SCHEDULED: &lt;<span style="background-color:#fff0f0">2021-05-08 Sat</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">* </span>TODO CLean the office
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#888">  SCHEDULED: </span><span style="color:#c00;font-weight:bold">&lt;2021-05-10 Mon +7d&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
To edit an existing timestamp, place the cursor on the year, month or date and move it with the up and down arrow keys.</p>
<p>
Only add a scheduled date if this is the time that you plan to do the action. Try not to add self-imposed schedules because you will over commit your day. A deadline is only helpful if there is an external expectation that you need to complete something by a specific day, for example, get travel insurance before your flight leaves. In my productivity approach, I only add scheduled dates or deadlines if they are externally set or for my list of weekly actions.</p>

Reflect: Reflect on your progress

<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The key of any productivity workflow is to regularly review your list of actions, your priorities and goals. The central tool in Org mode to look at your list of registered actions is the agenda.</p>
<p>
The agenda provides a summary of all your headings with an action status.  Before you can view the agenda, you need to do some minimal configuration.</p>
<p>
Firstly, it is common practice to bind <code class="verbatim">C-c a</code> to the agenda menu. You will also need to let Org-Mode know where you store the files with action items. The example below uses two files to create the agenda.</p>
<div class="src src-emacs-lisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#888">;; Agenda files. Change to your chosen file(s)</span>
