<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using Emacs for a couple of years, slowly learning and tuning up my config. I was trying to fix a bug using <code>emacs -Q</code> and then evaluating a minimal elisp block to load the locations of installed packages, but I found I was getting an error when evaluating <code>(package-initialize)</code>. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I&#39;m now on Emacs 27.2, and I&#39;ve found out that apparently <code>(package-initialize)</code> isn&#39;t required for <code>v&gt;27.0</code>. If that&#39;s the case, my first <code>config.org</code> block for packages must be a little incorrect. Here it is: </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <pre><code>(require &#39;package) (let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type &#39;(windows-nt ms-dos)) (not (gnutls-available-p)))) (proto (if no-ssl &quot;http&quot; &quot;https&quot;))) (when no-ssl (warn &quot;\ Your version of Emacs does not support SSL connections, which is unsafe because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks. There are two things you can do about this warning: 1. Install an Emacs version that does support SSL and be safe. 2. Remove this warning from your init file so you won&#39;t see it again.&quot;)) ;; Comment/uncomment these two lines to enable/disable MELPA and MELPA Stable as desired (add-to-list &#39;package-archives (cons &quot;melpa&quot; (concat proto &quot;://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) t) (add-to-list &#39;package-archives (cons &quot;melpa-stable&quot; (concat proto &quot;://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) t) (when (&lt; emacs-major-version 24) ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib (add-to-list &#39;package-archives (cons &quot;gnu&quot; (concat proto &quot;://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;))))) (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority &quot;NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3&quot;) (package-initialize) ;; Load paths to various packages and themes (add-to-list &#39;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/org-9.1.14/lisp/&quot;) (add-to-list &#39;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/org-9.1.14/contrib/lisp&quot; t) (add-to-list &#39;custom-theme-load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/themes/&quot;) (add-to-list &#39;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/vendor/emacs-powerline&quot;) </code></pre> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Is the <code>(package-initialize)</code> redundant here? Is the rest more-or-less appropriate?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I actually handle almost all my packages with <code>use-package</code>, but I don&#39;t have a <code>(require &#39;use-package)</code> line, presumably because it isn&#39;t mentioned on the <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#installing-use-package">github README</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nonreligious"> /u/nonreligious </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wo1mkz/proper_use_of_packageintialize_and_package_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wo1mkz/proper_use_of_packageintialize_and_package_in/">[comments]</a></span>
