<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi - how can you search for tagless headings (headings without any tags added) in org files? All the search options/functions I can find allow filtering or selection by specific tags, but I can&#39;t find a :no-tag or similar to use as argument</p> <p>(my org roam daily workflow involves tagging headlines by topic, sometimes i miss the tag on capturing the note, so want to go back and file all notes (headings within files) that don&#39;t have tags)</p> <p>thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redoakprof"> /u/redoakprof </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm51pe/search_for_tagless_headings_in_org_files/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm51pe/search_for_tagless_headings_in_org_files/">[comments]</a></span>
