<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Software monoliths are sort of an older way of building software, and making things small and single purpose has been <del>Linux wisdom</del> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix Philosophy</a> that is usually right. Emacs is the biggest threat to hypocrisy here, since it can itself be considered a huge monolith that does everything. Aside from that, however, there are other remarkable monoliths (giant pieces of software with huge code-bases and broad functionality) in the emacs ecosystem, some of which are so big and established and useful that they are hard to replace. What are some of your favorites, and what do they do that is hard to replace for you?</p> <p>Here are some of mine:</p> <ul> <li>Org-mode. It&#39;s breadth is actually part of its value-proposition with literate programming in many languages, publication to a plethora of outputs, and rich note-taking (code notebook-style) to an extent unreached by any other tool of which I&#39;m aware. Plus it&#39;s really good for actually taking tech/class notes.</li> <li>Gnus. Letting me easily* do email across many addresses in emacs, and integrating well with the related monolith...</li> <li>BBDB. It has great support for all manner of contacts and, apparently, all sorts of exports, with prevalent and rich interfaces.</li> <li>Helm. Really a swiss-army knife of completion, but there have been a plethora of lighter more specific altervatives in the past few years. Nonetheless, my students loved the ease and &quot;do it all&quot; made possible by Helm.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WorldsEndless"> /u/WorldsEndless </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wnk7gh/emacs_and_software_monoliths/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wnk7gh/emacs_and_software_monoliths/">[comments]</a></span>
