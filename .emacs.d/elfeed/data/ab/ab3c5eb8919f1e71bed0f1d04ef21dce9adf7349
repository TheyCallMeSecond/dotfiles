<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I tried emacs out in the late 90s, and gave up because I couldn&#39;t remap `C-x` to `&#39;next-line` (I still use WordStar keybindings, mock away). I thought I&#39;d try again. It&#39;s been 25 years. Surely you can re-map `C-x` by now? It even has evil-mode, so it might work.</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t work. At least I can&#39;t get it to work.</p> <p>It works fine if I open a file and do normal stuff. As soon as I try to use `counsel-describe-function` or really almost anything in the mini-buffer at all... blamo. `C-x` is mapped to something else, and I get `Key Sequence C-x X starts with non-prefix key C-x`</p> <p>So, is there a way to fix this? Or should I just try again in 25 years?</p> <p>--- Update for Posterity ---</p> <p>This effectively can&#39;t be done. If you want to map C-x or C-c to a non-prefix command, every time you open a file and some minor-mode kicks in, it can remap if it wants to. And lots of modes add keys to the C-x or C-c prefix, thereby un-mapping your command.</p> <p>I guess it might be possible w/ a metric-ton of emacs-foo, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for the mere mortal. I&#39;ve tried 3-4 different approaches I&#39;ve found around the web. They all break in another way within an hour of actual use.<br/> In general, I don&#39;t think you can really manage custom keybinding that work near-globally at all. I think you either have to use emcs&#39;s defaults w/ small tweaks, or evilMode which does all this work (mostly, it still fails to map vi-bindings when some minor-modes kick in).</p> <p>So, 25 years later? Same concussion as before. Ironicaly emacs is one of the most un-customizable editors when it comes to keybindings.</p> <p>To be fair, vim has similar problems. But most of those come from the terminal not passing/knowing certain keys. Can&#39;t remap C-; in vim easily either.</p> <p>It&#39;s too bad. I was enjoying emacs for the hour or so before it break.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LastCenturyMan"> /u/LastCenturyMan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wog0zp/trying_emacs_again_remap_cx_everywhere/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wog0zp/trying_emacs_again_remap_cx_everywhere/">[comments]</a></span>
