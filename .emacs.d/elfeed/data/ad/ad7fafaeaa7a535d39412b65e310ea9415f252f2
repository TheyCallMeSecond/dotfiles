<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As of recent, all my bindings created with <code>(bind-key*)</code> just don&#39;t work. (The star means, &quot;override all minor-mode bindings&quot;, if I recall correctly.) I don&#39;t get any errors or warnings (the package gets loaded fine), but the bindings aren&#39;t made.</p> <p>After lots of fiddling with my config and packages, I noticed that using the unstarred version does work: <code>(bind-key)</code>. </p> <p>Does anybody know what&#39;s going on? Has anybody else notice this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pailanderCO"> /u/pailanderCO </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmm7gd/recent_problem_with_bindkey/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmm7gd/recent_problem_with_bindkey/">[comments]</a></span>
