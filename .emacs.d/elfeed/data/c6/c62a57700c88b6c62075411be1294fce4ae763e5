<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I transitioned to (vanilla) Emacs two months ago, after using Vim for the last 8 years or so---I&#39;m loving it!</p> <p>I also forced myself out of the comfort zone and practiced plain Emacs keybinding, and I&#39;m quite comfortable with it.</p> <p>However, the only thing I miss from (Neo)vim as an ex-vimmer is <code>C-o</code> and <code>C-i</code> to jump back and forth.</p> <p>I found this <a href="https://github.com/gilbertw1/better-jumper">better-jumper</a> package and tried to use it: <code>emacs-lisp (use-package better-jumper :ensure t :init (better-jumper-mode 1) :config (define-key input-decode-map &quot;\\C-i&quot; \[C-i\]) :bind ((&quot;C-o&quot; . &#39;better-jumper-jump-backward) (&quot;C-i&quot; . &#39;better-jumper-jump-forward))) </code> But it doesn&#39;t seem to automatically record positions. For instance, I want to move back to where I was after I <code>C-M-.</code> via <code>C-o</code>.</p> <p>Is there a way to automatically do this without full-fledged Doom emacs or evil-mode?</p> <p>I&#39;m fine with cherry-picking only this feature from evil-mode, btw.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeta611"> /u/Zeta611 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmqmnn/trying_to_get_betterjumper_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmqmnn/trying_to_get_betterjumper_work/">[comments]</a></span>
