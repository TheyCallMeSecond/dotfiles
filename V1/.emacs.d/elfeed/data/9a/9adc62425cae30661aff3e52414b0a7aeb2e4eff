<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m curious: I know that there exist many exporting features to sync org-mode agendas as calendar files (.ics etc...) to view your agenda in a calendar GUI. However, what I&#39;m curious about (and wish to find) is a package which displays your org-mode agenda in an org table calendar? So that you don&#39;t have to export anything. It would all be displayed in an emacs buffer with a table layout and links to agenda events? Does this exist?</p> <p>I figured since I&#39;m doing almost everything in emacs now for organization, why not include a calendar view as well?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TyrionBean"> /u/TyrionBean </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wnmk6t/orgmode_agenda_in_a_calendar_view_with_tables/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wnmk6t/orgmode_agenda_in_a_calendar_view_with_tables/">[comments]</a></span>
