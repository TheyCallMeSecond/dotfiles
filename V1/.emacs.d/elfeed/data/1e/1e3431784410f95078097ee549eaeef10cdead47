<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>Yes, this is another post about someone switching editors. I know, there are a lot, but I think those are important because that kind of posts drove my decisions in the past.</p> <p>I move constantly between editors (Vim =&gt; Emacs =&gt; Neovim =&gt; Emacs =&gt; Neovim =&gt; Vscode (1 day) =&gt; Neovim =&gt; ...). The only thing that is nonnegotiable is modal editing.</p> <p>Last time I switched from Emacs because of the **huge** amount of time it takes to open (no, I do not like emacsclient). IIRC, it was taking 8s to start in my machine. Hence, I migrate to Neovim and Lua.</p> <p>Neovim is a fantastic project! Lua will bring it to a new level! However, I started to miss a GUI and some polished tools I had in Emacs. All GUIs in Neovim are almost a terminal in a graphical application. It really does not add something new. Furthermore, since Lua integration is relatively new, I often find some rough edges. 99% can be fixed relatively easily. However, I just do not have time anymore to tweak my configuration as I had back in the day.</p> <p>So, I heard about gccemacs and tried again. WOW! That&#39;s a game changer!</p> <p>After 20 min compiling everything shipped with Doom emacs by default (yes, this is the bad side of the tradeoff), Emacs starts in less than 2s. It is even faster than my Neovim with all plugins. So, if anyone quit Emacs because of performance, give it one more try. Just do not mind the initial compilation time...</p> <p>Finally, I just want to thanks the amazing job of <a href="/u/hlissner">u/hlissner</a>, Doom Emacs is amazing and you can use it out-of-the-box. Exactly what I need now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ronis_BR"> /u/Ronis_BR </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmq6wy/there_and_back_again_again/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmq6wy/there_and_back_again_again/">[comments]</a></span>
