<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve decided to give Emacs one last try, but need exact instructions for the following simple feature.</p> <p>You click a button / press a hotkey, choose a folder (not a file!), and Emacs opens up an Emacs window with a tree view of that folder&#39;s contents. In this tree view, folders are expandable and collapsible. Clicking files in this tree-view opens them as buffers for editing in the main window. </p> <p>In other words, I want the same basic experience as in Kate or VS Code when you click &quot;open folder&quot;.</p> <p>Please don&#39;t answer with just &quot;projectile&quot; or &quot;dired&quot;. I need exact, detailed, reproducible steps, or an Elisp script. What to put into init.el after I install the packages, which hotkeys to map, how to make it all work together. Because last time I rage quit Emacs after spending a ton of time, and seeing that the different plugins (Ivy, Projectile, Treemacs) didn&#39;t synchronize with each other.</p> <p>Or just tell me that Emacs can&#39;t do that, so I don&#39;t ever spend any time on it =)</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Linguistic-mystic"> /u/Linguistic-mystic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wottp2/teaching_emacs_to_open_foldersprojects/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wottp2/teaching_emacs_to_open_foldersprojects/">[comments]</a></span>
