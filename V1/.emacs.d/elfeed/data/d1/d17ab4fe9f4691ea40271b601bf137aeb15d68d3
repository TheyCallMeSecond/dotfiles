<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I built emacs 29.0.50 from source and I ran into the problem where I have to set the SNAP variables to 1 for the xwidget-webkit browser to work. Everything seems to work fine except for videos. I have checked youtube, reddit, dailymotion, etc. and none of them seem to work. They keep loading forever. Not even short, 10s videos load up. Is this another webkit but or an emacs related problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cuntymccuntlicker"> /u/cuntymccuntlicker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm7hz8/videos_on_webkit_stuck_in_infinite_load/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm7hz8/videos_on_webkit_stuck_in_infinite_load/">[comments]</a></span>
