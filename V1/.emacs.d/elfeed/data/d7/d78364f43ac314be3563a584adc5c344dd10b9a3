<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Puh, I tried to understand spell checking in Emacs and got overwhelmed by the possibilities I can find on the internet.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what to choose. After reading around I can define this minimals.</p> <ul> <li>Spellchecking of by default.</li> <li>shortcut for toggeling on/off</li> <li>Switching between languages English and German</li> <li>Choose between suggested corrections</li> <li>Save &quot;new&quot; words</li> </ul> <p>As and addon it would be nice but doesn&#39;t have to: - Use German and English in the same buffer at the same time - Spell check docstrings in Python code</p> <p>Sidenote: I am not sure if this is relevant but in Python I use eglot as LSP which checks my code (via flycheck8 or flymake8 or something with fly...).</p> <p>Sidenote2: In some web source I saw that ivy and custom also are relevant here. I use both of them in my init.el.</p> <p>Sidenote3: 95% of time I use Emacs in terminal via SSH and not in gui mode.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wWA5RnA4n2P3w2WvfHq"> /u/wWA5RnA4n2P3w2WvfHq </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlqdxv/overwhelming_spellchecking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlqdxv/overwhelming_spellchecking/">[comments]</a></span>
