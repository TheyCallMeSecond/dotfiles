<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. I would like to ask whether it is possible to speed up the first GTK3 frame creation (not `init.el` loading)</p> <p>Background: Emacs 28.1 with GTK3 on ArchLinux (Awesome WM) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Gnome 3.36), both with Xorg. The config is on <a href="https://github.com/igorepst/dotfiles-reboot/tree/master/packages/emacs/config/emacs">GitHub</a>. On both machines the startup time for a non daemon Emacs UI instance is roughly the same and fluctuates between 0.46-0.55 seconds (depending on machine load perhaps, not sure), measured by `emacs-init-time`. The same measurement when opening a frame created from daemon (by `systemd`, but it shouldn&#39;t matter) or in terminal is 0.104 sec. When using `emacs -Q` it is 0.319 sec.</p> <p>So, although the startup times are fine, I anyway would like to find a way to lessen the time it takes to draw a GTK3 frame which is roughly 0.3 sec. as far as I understand (this is by simply calculating the difference between non-daemon UI init time and a daemon one). </p> <p>Why? Because I want it faster and because the frame flickers when it is drawn :)</p> <p>So, basically this is not about the speed of `init` loading, but UI drawing (although I will gladly accept suggestions to speed up the init as well [the config is in the works, I choose not to use `use-package`, but instead to employ manual tweaks]).</p> <p>Is it even possible to lessen this time? By the measurement of `-Q` it seems not...</p> <p>Thank you in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/igorepst"> /u/igorepst </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlseeh/speed_of_creating_the_first_gtk3_frame/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlseeh/speed_of_creating_the_first_gtk3_frame/">[comments]</a></span>
