<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to emacs (I use doom) and was changing around my .init file and enabled ivy because I heard that it helps with searching, but then I stopped being able to fuzzy search for files anymore for some reason. I tried adding +fuzzy to ivy but I still can&#39;t figure it out. I used to be able to press &lt;space .&gt; then add **/ to search through all child directories for the file I&#39;m looking for but now it just looks for a file with **/ at the start. I tried un-adding ivy to see if that would bring it back but nothing changed.</p> <p>Thank you for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Restitutionshot"> /u/Restitutionshot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm4d80/cant_figure_out_how_to_fuzzy_search_for_files_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm4d80/cant_figure_out_how_to_fuzzy_search_for_files_in/">[comments]</a></span>
