<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ideally, I&#39;d like to get credentials (e.g. for API endpoints) from my environment when developing in python. However Emacs doesn&#39;t see them (I don&#39;t run it from terminal).</p> <p>Now there is the package <code>exec-path-from-shell</code> that loads the <code>PATH</code> variable and that&#39;s nice and dandy. But I need other variables (possibly dozens of APIs for different projects). </p> <p>Is there any reasonable way to do it?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/suhrob"> /u/suhrob </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmeud8/how_to_handle_credentials_for_python_in_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmeud8/how_to_handle_credentials_for_python_in_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
