<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Everyone&#39;s different. I would like to get a take from the community on my situation here.</p> <p>I&#39;m approaching middle age and have always tried to use ergonomic tools &amp; techniques and yet I am developing RSI. My right hand is particularly bad. I have an appointment with my doctor to have a chat about it, but I am pretty sure that contorting my thumbs/hands in general to hit the meta/ctrl/shift keys have not helped me.</p> <p>I have enjoyed some modal editing in my journey. My current favorite packages for that are Meow &amp; god-mode. I honestly have not decided which I like better but both &quot;de-chord&quot; my commands. Meow does this with a &quot;keypad&quot; mode that is for all intents and purposes a leader key. This adds 1 additional key press in exchange for no modifiers. Meow has better text navigation, overall god-mode reduces key-presses much more dramatically.</p> <p>I am also considering learning/training myself to use both hands at all times and avoid pressing 2 keys with one hand at any given time. This only gets dicey with 3 key chords (like C-M-/M-S-/C-S/-).</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to get a sense of which is the best course of action here. Heck, maybe I should do both?</p> <p><em>EDIT:</em> You all have been amazing. Thank you so much for the advice! If I did not manage to respond to you please know that I am grateful</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tangonov"> /u/tangonov </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmbshu/yet_another_rsi_thread/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wmbshu/yet_another_rsi_thread/">[comments]</a></span>
