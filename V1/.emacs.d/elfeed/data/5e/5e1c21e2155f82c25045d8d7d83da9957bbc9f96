<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I cloned the github repo of emacs today (version 29.0.50) and configured it with the following flags</p> <p>--with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-xwidgets</p> <p>Everything works fine, and I am even able to browse wikipedia. But when I try to open youtube within the xwidget-webkit browser, it loads to 89% and then crashes emacs. When I look in the terminal where I originally launched emacs, I find the error:</p> <pre><code>Unable to configure xdg-desktop-portal access in the WebKit sandbox: GApplication is required. </code></pre> <p>I then recompiled by adding --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 but I got the same behavior. Does anyone else run into this problem?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I exported WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=&quot;0&quot; and youtube does not crash emacs anymore. However, videos are still not playing, stuck in the loading screen. Is this a webkit problem? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cuntymccuntlicker"> /u/cuntymccuntlicker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm0wro/unable_to_configure_xdgdesktopportal_access_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wm0wro/unable_to_configure_xdgdesktopportal_access_in/">[comments]</a></span>
