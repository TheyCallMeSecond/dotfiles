<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I am an Emacs newbie coming from vim. So far I really like the Emacs experience! However, I still struggle with a very simple task: I like having an internal border around my frame, which I set via the <code>default-frame-alist</code> list. While that works fine I am not able to automatically adjust the internal-frame color to the theme&#39;s background color. I can do it manually buy using</p> <pre><code>(defun my/adjust_internal_border_color () &quot;Adjust the internal border color to match the theme&#39;s background color&quot; (custom-set-faces! &#39;(internal-border :background &quot;#FAFAFA&quot; ;; (format &quot;%s&quot; (upcase (prin1-to-string ((car (cdr (assoc &#39;bg doom-themes--colors))))))) ;; (car (cdr (assoc &#39;bg doom-themes--colors))) )) ) </code></pre> <p>Though, when I try to do it automatically by using one of the commented lines above instead of the color string, I get a <code>Wrong type argument: strings, ...</code> error. I guess this is due to my very poor knowledge of Lisp and probably very easy to fix. Maybe one of you can help me out?</p> <p>Many thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychological-Try449"> /u/Psychological-Try449 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wowk6l/problems_with_automatically_setting_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wowk6l/problems_with_automatically_setting_a/">[comments]</a></span>
