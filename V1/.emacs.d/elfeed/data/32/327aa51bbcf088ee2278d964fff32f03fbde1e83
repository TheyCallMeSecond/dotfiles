<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>According to<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Building-Emacs.html">the docs</a>, the c source files generate an executable called temacs which is just the lisp interpreter plus IO routines. This then loads the lisp libraries which provide the full emacs experience. The manual then says that temacs dumps some files according to the shell arguments it received.</p> <p>If it received pdump, it dumps an exact copy of itself plus the recorded routines from the lisp libraries it loaded (into a file called emacs.pdump).</p> <p>If it received dump, it dumps an executable lisp image of itself with all the lisp libraries already loaded.</p> <p>It would make sense to me that the 2nd option is the one used to distribute emacs via package managers, but according to the docs, this option is deprecated. </p> <p>Does this mean that when i apt install emacs, I am installing the exact copy of temacs + an emacs.pdump file?</p> <p>Also, if using &quot;pdump&quot; the dumped executable is an exact copy of temacs, could I stop the build process right after the C source has compiled and use temacs as a bare bones emacs (maybe load the lisp libraries myself)?</p> <p>Im not planning to do this, im just curious about the mechanics of the process.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/guachoperez"> /u/guachoperez </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlmtxm/when_i_apt_install_emacs_does_it_install/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlmtxm/when_i_apt_install_emacs_does_it_install/">[comments]</a></span>
