<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am curious what your strategies/approaches are for using a literate org config.</p> <p>Currently I have the following in my <code>init.el</code>:</p> <p><code>elisp (require &#39;org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;/path/to/config.org&quot;)) </code></p> <p>My whole configuration resides in a single, separate org file, including the early-init part (which is tangled to a separate <code>early-init.el</code> file in <code>user-emacs-directory</code>).</p> <p>Whilst this mostly works fine, this approach gives me issues when I try to use the latest version of <code>org-mode</code> via <code>straight.el</code>. I believe this is caused by the fact that I&#39;m loading the built-in <code>org</code> version in <code>init.el</code>, and then trying to load/use an updated version in <code>config.org</code> (which causes some <code>void variable</code> errors for me).</p> <p>Alternative strategies are to put something like <code>(load-file &quot;config.el&quot;)</code> in <code>init.el</code>, and tangle <code>config.org</code> manually or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/jy8fuc/orgbabeltangle_on_save/">on save</a>.</p> <p>Just curious how you all are using your literate org config file, and whether there is anyone who was able to solve/avoid the issue with <code>org</code> that I&#39;m having (I could stick to the built-in version, but I would like to be able to use the latest version).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fast-90"> /u/fast-90 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wn94ne/strategies_for_literate_config_in_orgmode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wn94ne/strategies_for_literate_config_in_orgmode/">[comments]</a></span>
