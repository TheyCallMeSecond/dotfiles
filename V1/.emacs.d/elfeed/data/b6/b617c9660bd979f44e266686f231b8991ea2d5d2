<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like <a href="https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow">Steve Purcell&#39;s SanityInc Tomorrow themes</a>, but would like something between <code>night</code> and <code>bright</code>.</p> <p>I copied <code>emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/sanityinc-tomorrow-night-theme.el</code> and <code>./emacs/.local/elpa/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-20220412.1643/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el</code> to <code>~/.config/doom/themes</code> and added <code>my-</code> to each. I then added a color definition I called <code>dusk</code> to <code>my-color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow.el</code>:</p> <p><code> 69c69,82 &lt; &#39;((night . ((background . &quot;#1d1f21&quot;) --- &gt; &#39;((dusk .

Is there a simple way to define a theme with the colors I want without all the intricacies that are in this set of themes?</p> <p>In fact, I might use <code>afternoon</code> or <code>dark+</code> if I could make the alt-background (I think it is) more prominent.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aqjo"> /u/aqjo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wocwxa/doom_trying_to_tweak_an_existing_theme_not_having/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wocwxa/doom_trying_to_tweak_an_existing_theme_not_having/">[comments]</a></span>
