<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am most sure that I am not using correct terms while asking this question because I don&#39;t even know what the correct terms are. Maybe you can help as you read my question.</p> <p>I have encountered so many hooks in Emacs for different types buffers. Like ielm-mode-hook, term-mode-hook, text-mode-hook, prog-mode-hook. Sure there must be many more.</p> <p>While disabling or enabling some features using these hooks I am never sure if I have enabled or disabled it on all the hooks.</p> <p>Like I want to add line numbers to any &quot;text non-I/O&quot; buffers. By this mean only buffers where I write text or code but do not run REPL or any interactive tools. Are text-mode-hook and prog-mode-hook enough? Am I missing some other hooks?</p> <p>What if I want to add some function to &quot;interactive I/O&quot; buffers like REPLs, terminals, or other interactive tools? Like if I have line numbers enabled by default but I want to disable them in interactive buffers like this, is it enough to hook that function to term-mode-hook and ielm-mode-hook? Am I missing any other hooks?</p> <p>Is there a full list of hooks somewhere? At least the built-in ones? Is there some categorizing of those hooks like these ones are just for writing text and these ones are for interactive buffers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brightlystar"> /u/brightlystar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wo5o8i/is_there_a_full_list_of_mode_hooks_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wo5o8i/is_there_a_full_list_of_mode_hooks_for/">[comments]</a></span>
