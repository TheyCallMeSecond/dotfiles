<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use Emacs mostly for research in the humanities. Linking to PDFs, storing notes, annotating documents, and writing and editing documents. </p> <p>I think my key packages are pdf-tools, org mode, org-roam, org-transclusion, org-remark, and org-roam-bibtex with citar. I use straight.el + use-package to manage my packages.</p> <p>I do a lot of my reading Zotero and then export stuff to Emacs, but I&#39;d be interested in moving more to Emacs too. </p> <p>Currently using selectrum, but I hear that&#39;s being phased out in favour of vertico. I&#39;ve liked prescient and I believe there&#39;s a hack to use it with vertico. I have consult installed too, although I haven&#39;t used marginalia or corfu yet. Interested in using them though!</p> <p>Any other cool packages that might work for my use case of finding documents, writing documents, and displaying connections between them?</p> <p>Or just quality of life improvement stuff? E.g. Zotero or Firefox integration, better buffer management, better scrolling, UI stuff.</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard a lot of great things about evil, so interested in adding that to my init, but I&#39;ve never used vim by itself. Any cool guides to getting started with evil that don&#39;t assume vim knowledge? </p> <p>And what additional elements of the evil ecosystem should I add? I can&#39;t tell the difference between <a href="https://github.com/GuiltyDolphin/org-evil">org-evil</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Somelauw/evil-org-mode">evil-org</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ahopefullycuterrobot"> /u/ahopefullycuterrobot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlv90d/about_to_declare_emacs_bankruptcy_any_advice_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wlv90d/about_to_declare_emacs_bankruptcy_any_advice_for/">[comments]</a></span>
